  	title={Towards a Typology of Feedback Systems},
  	author={Sanfilippo, Dario and Valle, Andrea},
	abstract={Feedback-based systems for audio synthesis and processing have been in use since the’60s, resulting both from the theoretical reflection on Cybernetics and System theory, and from the practical experimentation on analog circuits. The advent of computers has made possible the implementation of complex theoretical systems into audiodomain oriented applications, in some sense bridging the gap between theory and practice in the analog domain, and further increasing the range of audio/musical applications of feedback systems. In this paper, we first briefly introduce feedback systems; then, we propose a set of features to characterize them; finally we propose a typology targeted at feedback systems used in the audio/musical domain, and discuss some relevant examples.},

	abstract={Feedback-based systems for audio synthesis and processing have been in use since the’60s, resulting both from the theoretical reflection on Cybernetics and System Theory and from the practical experimentation on analog circuits. Taking into account the variety of feedback configurations and typologies, the|.(bar dot) project aims at defining and implementing the notion of heterogeneously-coupled feedback system. In order to define heterogeneity, we first briefly introduce historically the use of feedback systems in the audio/music domain and sketch a typology based on 5 categories depending on opposite binary features. We then present the|.(bar dot) project, a duo of radical improvisation exclusively based on coupling via feedback two different sound generation systems, as an example of a heterogeneously-coupled feedback system, where opposite typological features are present.},

  	title={Environment-Mediated Coupling of Autonomous Sound-Generating Systems in Live Performance: An Overview of the Machine Milieu Project},
  	author={Sanfilippo, Dario and Di Scipio, Agostino},
	abstract={Today, a large variety of technical configurations are used
in live performance contexts. In most of them, computers and other devices act usually as powerful yet subordinated agencies, typically piloted by performers: with few
notable exceptions, large-scale gestures and structural developments are left either to the performer’s actions or to
well-planned automations and/or composing algorithms.
At the same time, the performance environment is either ignored or ’tuned out’, ideally kept neutral with regard to the
actual sound events and the overall performance process.
This paper describes a different approach. The authors
investigate the complex dynamics arising in live performance when multiple autonomous sound systems are coupled through the acoustic environment. In order to allow
for more autonomous and adaptive – or better: ecosystemic – behaviour on the part of the machines, the authors suggest that the notion of interaction should be replaced with that of a permanent and continuing structural
coupling between machine(s), performer(s) and environment(s). More particularly, the paper deals with a specific configuration of two (or more) separate computer-based audio systems co-evolving in their autonomic processes based on permanent mutual exchanges through and
with the local environment, i.e., in the medium of sound
only. An attempt is made at defining a self-regulating, situated, and hybrid dynamical system having its own agency
and manifesting its potential behaviour in the performance
process. Human agents (performers) can eventually intrude and explore affordances and constraints specific to
the performance ecosystem, possibly biasing or altering
its emergent behaviours. In so doing, what human agents
actually achieve is to specify their role and function in the
context of a larger, distributed kind of agency created by
the whole set of highly interdependent components active
in sound. That may suggest new solutions in the area of improvised or structured performance and in the sound arts
in general.
Overall, the approach taken here allows for an empirical
investigation of the mobile and porous boundaries between
the kind of environmental agency connoting densely connected networks, on one hand, and the freedom (however
restricted) in independent and intentional behaviour on the
part of human agents intruding the ecosystem, on the other},

  	author={Sanfilippo, Dario},
	abstract={This paper presents the Edge of Chaos library, a set of Faust
functions dedicated to the implementation of music complex adaptive systems through time-variant audio feedback networks. The
paper first describes the background and the motivations behind
the library, then it discusses the library modules and some of the
most relevant functions. The library includes eight modules for
information processing, sound processing and generation, stability processing for self-oscillating designs, and mapping strategies.
Lastly, the paper discusses future work for the library to transform
it into a music complex adaptive systems generator software for
live performance. The library is available on Github
and it is published under the GNU GPL v2.0 license.},

  	author={Bovermann, Till and Sanfilippo, Dario},
	abstract={Although digital data are adorned by the myth of lossless transmission and migration, everyday experience does prove the existence
of degradation and, ultimately, data loss in various forms. As it
turns out, 1-bit-based information representation for audio is of
particular interest in terms of digital deterioration research. We
therefore introduce BITDSP as a set of FAUST library functions to
explore and research artistic possibilities of bit-based algorithms
with FAUST. After introducing and discussing three data formats
to handle 1-bit data streams, concrete implementations of bit-based
functions ranging from simple bit operations over classic deltasigma modulations to more experimental approaches like cellular
automata, recursive Boolean networks, and linear feedback shift
registers are introduced. In a third part, creative applications utilising the described library are presented.},

  	author={Sanfilippo, Dario and Parker, Julian D.},
	abstract={This paper presents a technique addressing signal discontinuity and concatenation artefacts in real-time granular processing with rectangular windowing. By combining zero-crossing synchronicity, first-order derivative analysis, and Lagrange polynomials, we can generate streams of uncorrelated and non-overlapping sonic fragments with minimal low-order derivatives discontinuities. The resulting open-source algorithm, implemented in the Faust language, provides a versatile real-time software for dynamical looping, wavetable oscillation, and granulation with reduced artefacts due to rectangular windowing and no artefacts from overlap-add-to-one techniques commonly deployed in granular processing.},

  	author={Sanfilippo, Dario},
	abstract={In this paper, we discuss the implementation of look-ahead peak limiters using exponential envelope followers and their deployment in multi-band loudness maximisation. Particularly, the limiter’s amplitude profiling algorithm uses cascaded one-pole filters to improve derivative continuity and reduce convolution artefacts when multiplying the input signal by the attenuation gain as shown in a total harmonic distortion analysis. The maximiser algorithm allows for two independent maximisation modalities that can be combined: an RMS-based dynamic normalisation of each band with controllable depth to reach equal power, and a global maximisation gain that boosts the individual bands by the same amount. An open-source FAUST implementation of these algorithms is available on Github at the links: https://github.com/dariosanfilippo/limiterStereo and https://github.com/dariosanfilippo/maximiser.

  	title={Constrained Differential Equations as Complex Sound Generators},
  	author={Sanfilippo, Dario},
    	abstract = {This paper presents investigations for complex sound generation based on modified classic chaotic differential equations. The modification consists of a constraining structure, a cascaded saturating nonlinearity and DC-blocker unit within the recursive paths of the differential equations. The new configuration allows for the exploration of these equations in unstable regions, increasing the parameters ranges allowed and extending sonic possibilities. Furthermore, the configuration implements a low-level competing mechanism between positive and negative feedback relations that forces oscillation and enhances complex variations both at timbral and formal time scales. The resulting systems exhibit phase spaces with nontrivial trajectories and show potential for computer music and, particularly, applications requiring some degree of autonomy. The sound generators are implemented in the Faust programming language and are published on Github under the GNU GPL v3.0 license.},
