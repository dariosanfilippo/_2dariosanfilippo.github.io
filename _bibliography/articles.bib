	abstract={This article introduces the history and aesthetics of feedback-based music, from early practitioners to more advanced methods and state-of-the-art works based on adaptation. Some of the most relevant techniques developed over almost six decades of investigations in the area of recursive systems for electronic music are discussed to show the variety and richness that a single specialised domain can have, providing examples of how scientific and philosophical principles can be translated into music. The historical context is key to understanding the evolution of the field: feedback-based music arose during the same years in which cybernetics, together with other disciplines, were experiencing a profound transformation. I will provide an overview of how such disciplines changed, highlighting the connections between seemingly distant areas such as philosophy, biology and engineering, and the fact that the development of feedback-based music appears to have followed somewhat closely the evolution of systems thinking. Finally, the article explores questions of musical aesthetics and music theory related to the use of complex autonomous systems in live performance through observations on the author's music practice.

	abstract={In this article, we will investigate the relationships between human performers and autonomous machines within the context of live music and improvisation. First, we propose a framework for improvisation based on cybernetic criteria to structurally couple human and artificial entities as hybrid systems of mutually-determining components. The human and the machine become entangled through incessant and mutating relationships as adaptations to information derived from low-level and high-level sound characteristics. Then, we explore notions of cybernetics for the implementation of human-machine interfaces that allow the performer to reshape the network of relationships within the system's components with agility and organicity. Lastly, the article investigates the role of electroacoustic devices and environments within the context of human-machine interfacing in live performance.},

@article{sanfilippo2021time,
	bibtex_show={true},
	abstract={In this paper, we present a set of time-domain algorithms for the low- and high-level analysis of audio streams. These include spectral centroid, noisiness, and spectral spread for the low level, and dynamicity, heterogeneity, and complexity for the high level. The low-level algorithms provide a continuous measure of the features and can operate with short analysis frames. The high-level algorithms, on the other hand, are original designs informed both perceptually and by complexity theory for the analysis of musically meaningful information, both in short sounds or articulated streams with long-term nontrivial variations.

These algorithms are suitable for the implementation of real-time audio analysis in diverse live performance setups that require the extraction of information from several streams at the same time. For example, the low-level algorithms can be deployed in large audio networks of adaptive agents, or in small-to-large ensembles for the analysis of various characteristics of the instruments for computer-assisted performance. Furthermore, the high-level algorithms can be implemented as part of fitness functions in music systems based on evolutionary algorithms that follow musically-informed criteria, or as analysis tools to assess the quality of some of the characteristics of a musical output.

Musical applications of these algorithms can be found in a companion paper in this issue of Computer Music Journal: “Complex Adaptation in Audio Feedback Networks for the Synthesis of Music and Sounds.”},

@article{sanfilippo2021complex,
	bibtex_show={true},
	abstract={This article presents recent outcomes of the author's research on musical complex adaptive systems (CASs). The first part focuses on the concepts of adaptation and complexity within the framework of CASs and suggests a rigorous placing of the concepts within the musical domain. This analysis involves a distinction of the notions of context and information between the engineering field of information theory and the philosophical one of radical constructivism. I conclude this section by showing that, in this approach, information and context are mutually determining.

Then, I introduce a technique related to the notion of evolvability in biology and genetic algorithms and that has significantly increased the complexity and long-term variety in music systems during autonomous evolutions. This technique distributes adaptation across higher levels and allows the system to reorganize the relationships among its agents and their structure circularly while interpreting and constructing its context.

To conclude, an autonomous live performance piece from 2019–2020, “Constructing Realities (Homage to Heinz von Foerster),” which implements the theories mentioned above, is described, showing DSP processes and techniques that relate to evolvability, autopoiesis, fitness, and complexity through agent-based modeling. This article is accompanied by a companion article discussing the technical aspects of information processing algorithms, which are an essential part for the implementation of music CASs: “Time-Domain Adaptive Algorithms for Low- and High-Level Audio Information Processing.”},

@article{sanfilippo2013feedback,
	bibtex_show={true},
	abstract={The use of feedback-based systems in the music domain dates back to the 1960s. Their applications span from music composition and sound organization to audio synthesis and processing, as the interest in feedback resulted both from theoretical reflection on cybernetics and system theory, and from practical experimentation on analog circuits. The advent of computers has made possible the implementation of complex theoretical systems in audio-domain oriented applications, in some sense bridging the gap between theory and practice in the analog domain, and further increasing the range of audio and musical applications of feedback systems. In this article we first sketch a minimal history of feedback in music; second, we briefly introduce feedback systems from a theoretical point of view; then we propose a set of features that characterize them from the perspective of music applications; finally, we propose a typology targeted at feedback systems used in the audio/musical domain and discuss some relevant examples.},

	abstract={In this paper I will discuss the implementation of cybernetic music systems based on feedback. As a case study, I will present my projects for human-computer interaction performance and autonomous interactive sound installations, LIES and SD/OS, describing their characteristics from a systemic perspective, their structure, and the concepts behind these works. Concepts such as complexity, self-dis/organisation, emergence and chaos are crucial to these works, as are those of autonomy and synergy. Feedback, a mechanism that makes the subversion of technology possible, is the key for the design of these systems and for establishing a strict coupling between environment, performer, and machine. It will be shown that in such music systems ‘noise’ can be the sole source of alimentation, and that sound affects itself, becoming a continuous perturbation for the spontaneous behaviour of such systems.},

@article{sanfilippo2018time,
	bibtex_show={true},
	abstract={The use of recursive time-variant networks for musical applications dates back to the 1960s with the seminal work of Gordon Mumma who implemented his own systems and circuits in the analogue domain. Practitioners like Nicolas Collins followed the same approach in the 1970s – particularly with works such as Pea Soup (1976) – and, in more modern times, this technique has been extended to the digital domain and thoroughly explored by composers such as Agostino Di Scipio and the author. The general framework for this approach is to establish several interdependent relationships among the information which is extracted from sound and the variables which affect sound itself, while also creating a structural coupling, i.e. a feedback loop, between information and sound processing. This configuration is the basis for the realisation of systems which can adapt – very broadly speaking – to the context they operate in, and that, under the right circumstances and implementations, can exhibit a complex autonomous behaviour, albeit maintaining a convincing variety over a long time span is a particularly challenging goal. The work presented here is based on a novel idea developed by the author, that is a time-variant network where the relationships between information and sound processing are themselves time-variant and context-dependent, resulting in a dynamical adaptivity, with the scope of enhancing the long-term variety and complexity of autonomous music systems. The author, after a discussion on adaptive systems which is necessary to better contextualise the conceptual and technical framework of the work, will proceed through a description of the system while providing connections to the artistic ideas and implications of this approach on the practice of live performance with autonomous systems.},
